# Rasta Tau Mile 

This is a collection of 43 poems written in a specific style of Urdu Poetry called `Nazm`. A `Nazm` is a free flowing text that explores one specific feeling or emotion. It can be topical and imbibe certain flow but the writer is free to choose or ignore the rhythm. `Nazm` represents a freedom from the rule based poetry. The idea is to have the writer as much leeway as she needs to express a thought. That is the reason `Nazm` was proclaimed to be the voice of progressive `Tarakki Yafta` poets. It was embraced by likes of `Kaifi Azmi` in his early days as an expression of the progressive movement. 

The book is about self discovery. Poet seeks himself amidst the chaotic eighties of India - a struggle between hope and failures , the growing pains of the society as much as within. Very evident in the title poem ..

In a way the poetical format - `Nazm` is a very apt choice for the topic at hand "Show me the path" . He is judicious with the words without compromising the freedom of the medium. 

### Recital 

Some of the poems are recited by Trishla Devi ; wife of Madan Maholvi recently as a tribute to Shayar. In 2021 , Trishla Devi , my mother ,  at the age of 83, read thease poems the way she must have heard first hand in eighties. The background score is Gregarion Chants by Kevin Macloyad.
