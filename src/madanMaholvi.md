Published in 1989 in Devnagri script, this books is a collection of his chosen poems. The book was forwarded by Shri Khushi Ram Sharma Vashisht, then `Rajya Kavi` of Haryana - India. Book received critical acclaim in the local circles of Hindi & Urdu poetry. Publishing Urdu poetry in Hindi (Devnagri) script was a bold move for that time. In a way it opened the door for non Urdu natives to a new and distinct style of poetry - `Nazm`.

In the words of Shri Krishna chandra Paagal , a local Hindi writer and a member of `Adbi sangam Kurukshetra`

> जगह जगह जिंदगी की सच्चाइयों, सुख-दुःख, कलह, उग्रवाद, मानवीय मूल्यों का बिखराव तथा वर्तमान की भयानक चुनौतियों के सजीव चित्र घंटों अपनी ओर देखने को मज़बूर करते हैं । सिद्धहस्त चित्रकार के सजीव रंग तथा कवि की कोमल अनुभूतियों का अनूठा सम्मिश्रण दिल की गहराइयों में अनायास ही उतरता चला जाता है

## Rasta Tau Mile

<img src=./rtmTitleCircle.jpg alt="Rasta Tau Mile" align="left">

This is a collection of 43 poems written in a specific style of Urdu Poetry called `Nazm`. A `Nazm` is a free flowing text that explores one specific feeling or emotion. It can be topical and imbibe certain flow but the writer is free to choose or ignore the rhythm. `Nazm` represents a freedom from the rule based poetry. The idea is to have the writer as much leeway as she needs to express a thought. That is the reason `Nazm` was proclaimed to be the voice of progressive `Tarakki Yafta` poets. It was embraced by likes of `Kaifi Azmi` in his early days as an expression of the progressive movement.

The book is about self discovery. Poet seeks himself amidst the chaotic eighties of India - a struggle between hope and failures , the growing pains of the society as much as within.

In a way the poetical format - `Nazm` is a very apt choice for the topic at hand "Show me the path" . He is judicious with the words without compromising the freedom of the medium.
