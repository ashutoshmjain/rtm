<h1> Madan Maholvi </h1>
</center>
Jnaab Madan Maholvi (1936 - 2005) , was my father and `ustaad`. I learnt the taste of `Urdu Shayri` from him . An accomplished painter , sculptor and poet : Madan Maholvi was at ease and regular practitioner of multiple art forms. A student of Shimla Fine Arts college , he practiced and taught these art forms to high schoolers , under grads and teachers through his life.

Haryana Urdu Academy published his `Shayri` in three covers.

A masters in history and an analyst of religion, he also has huge unpublished work on "Jain Dharma in Haryana"

This online resource is a collection of his published and unpublished work .. Mostly poems and short stories ..

## Fikr Ke Parinde

Published in 1989 in Devnagri script, this books is a collection of his chosen poems. The book was forwarded by Shri Khushi Ram Sharma Vashisht, then `Rajya Kavi` of Haryana - India. Book received critical acclaim in the local circles of Hindi & Urdu poetry. Publishing Urdu poetry in Hindi (Devnagri) script was a bold move for that time. In a way it opened the door for non Urdu natives to a new and distinct style of poetry - `Nazm`.

## Rasta Tau Mile

<img src=./rtmTitleCircle.jpg alt="Rasta Tau Mile" align="left">

This is a collection of 43 poems written in a specific style of Urdu Poetry called `Nazm`. A `Nazm` is a free flowing text that explores one specific feeling or emotion. It can be topical and imbibe certain flow but the writer is free to choose or ignore the rhythm. `Nazm` represents a freedom from the rule based poetry. The idea is to have the writer as much leeway as she needs to express a thought. That is the reason `Nazm` was proclaimed to be the voice of progressive `Tarakki Yafta` poets. It was embraced by likes of `Kaifi Azmi` in his early days as an expression of the progressive movement.

The book is about self discovery. Poet seeks himself amidst the chaotic eighties of India - a struggle between hope and failures , the growing pains of the society as much as within.

In a way the poetical format - `Nazm` is a very apt choice for the topic at hand "Show me the path" . He is judicious with the words without compromising the freedom of the medium.

## Recital

The audio recording and editing is through "open source" applications "Audacity" and "SoX". Audio files are stored at [internet archive](https://archive.org/details/rastaTauMile). The good thing about audio player from archive.org is it allows embedding individual tracks on web pages ; as well as all the sound tracks together kinda like a clickable playlist. Short of a podcast, I guess this is best uninterrupted audio experience ..

I am not a professional sound artist but my attempt is to invoke an eighties style "All India radio Urdu Service" audio experience. A laid back but thoughtful listening experience. I am seeking help from professional sound artists to improve upon these renditions.
