Jnaab Madan Maholvi (1936 - 2005) , was my `ustaad` (teacher). I learnt the taste of `Urdu Shayri` from him . An accomplished painter , sculptor and poet : Madan Maholvi was at ease and regular practitioner of multiple art forms. A student of Shimla Fine Arts college , he practiced and taught these art forms to high schoolers , under grads and teachers through his life.

A masters in history and an analyst of religion, he also has huge unpublished work on "Jain Dharma in Haryana"

This online resource `Maholvi-nama` is a collection of his published and unpublished work . Mostly poems and short stories.

In late eighties, `Haryana Urdu Academy` published his `Shayri` in three covers. Two in `Urdu` script and one in `Devnagri` script. 

Publishing Urdu poetry in Hindi (Devnagri) script was a bold move for that time. In a way it opened the door for non Urdu natives to a new and distinct style of poetry. Following the tradition, I have tried to provide `Hinglish` transliteration wherever possible to make this work accessible to those who have difficulty reading `devnagri` script. The transliteration and translation is a work in progress.

## फ़िक्र के परिंदे (Birds of thought)

Published in 1989 in `Devnagri` script, this books is a collection of his chosen poems from two previous `urdu` titles. Recognizing the effort to bring `Urdu Shayri` to `Hindi`, the book was forwarded by famous Hindi poet `Shri Khushi Ram Sharma Vashisht`, then `Rajya Kavi` of Haryana - India. Book received critical acclaim in the local circles of Hindi & Urdu poetry. 

In the words of `Shri Krishna chandra Paagal` , a local Hindi writer and a member of `Adbi sangam Kurukshetra`

> जगह जगह जिंदगी की सच्चाइयों, सुख-दुःख, कलह, उग्रवाद, मानवीय मूल्यों का बिखराव तथा वर्तमान की भयानक चुनौतियों के सजीव चित्र घंटों अपनी ओर देखने को मज़बूर करते हैं । सिद्धहस्त चित्रकार के सजीव रंग तथा कवि की कोमल अनुभूतियों का अनूठा सम्मिश्रण दिल की गहराइयों में अनायास ही उतरता चला जाता है

## रास्ता तो मिले (In search of Path)

This is a collection of 43 unpublished poems, written in a specific style of Urdu Poetry called `Nazm`. A `Nazm` is a free flowing text that explores one specific feeling or emotion. It can be topical and imbibe certain flow but the writer is free to choose or ignore the rhythm. `Nazm` represents a freedom from the rule based poetry. The idea is to have the writer as much leeway as she needs to express a thought. That is the reason `Nazm` was proclaimed to be the voice of progressive `Tarakki Yafta` poets. It was embraced by likes of `Kaifi Azmi` in his early days as an expression of the progressive movement.

The book is about self discovery. Poet seeks himself amidst the chaotic eighties of India - a struggle between hope and failures , the growing pains of the society as much as within.

In a way the poetical format - `Nazm` is a very apt choice for the topic at hand "Show me the path" . He is judicious with the words without compromising the freedom of the medium.
