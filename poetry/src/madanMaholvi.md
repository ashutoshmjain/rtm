This book is a collection of his unpublished work .. mostly poems and short stories .. 

# Rasta Tau Mile 

This is a collection of 43 poems written in a specific style of Urdu Poetry called `Nazm`. A `Nazm` is a free flowing text that explores one specific feeling or emotion. It can be topical and imbibe certain flow but the writer is free to choose or ignore the rhythm. `Nazm` represents a freedom from the rule based poetry. The idea is to have the writer as much leeway as she needs to express a thought. 

The book is about self discovery. Poet seeks himself amidst the chaotic eighties of India - a struggle between hope and failures , the growing pains of the society as much as within. Very evident in the title poem ..

In a way the poetical format - `Nazm` is a very apt choice for the topic at hand "Show me the path" . He is judicious with the words without compromising the freedom of the medium. 

I hope it will read well ..
