Jnaab Madan Maholvi (1936 - 2005) , was my father and `ustaad`. I learnt the taste of Urdu shayri from him . An accomplished painter , sculptor and poet : Madan Maholvi was at ease and regular practitioner of multiple art forms. A student of Shimla Fine Arts college , he practiced and taught these art forms to high schoolers , under grads and teachers through his life.
Haryana Urdu Academy published his shayri in three covers.

This book is a collection of his unpublished work .. mostly poems and short stories .. 

# Rasta Tau Mile 

This is a collection of 43 poems written in a specific style of Urdu Poetry called `Nazm`. A `Nazm` is a free flowing text that explores one specific feeling or emotion. It can be topical but and imbibe certain flow but the writer is free to choose or ignore the rhythm. `Nazm` represents a freedom from the rule based poetry. The idea is to have the writer as much leeway as she needs to express a thought. 

I hope the book will serve the purpose. The writer has taken this freedom of expression without losing the context.
